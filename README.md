# ngreact-test-utils
Utilities for testing Angular applications which use React and ngreact. 

Used for testing Angular directives which contain React components with [ngReact](https://github.com/ngReact/ngReact), or Angular directives which may be fully or partially migrated to React in the future, allowing existing tests to be maintained. 

These utilities are not for testing React components directly - for that I would recommend using [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme).

## Installation
